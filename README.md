### Pet Rock Simulator

Pet Rock Simulator is a game where you can choose a rock size, accessorize it, and then have it roll around in a open field. This
game uses unity and c# scripts to create various scenes and produce the overall game. Abby Starr built the rock size scene and
the choose accessory scene while Andrew Alini built the main menu and the simulator scene. Both Abby and Alini worked on hooking
up the various scenes with each other.


#### Usage

TODO!

To run the game, run the build ______ with a screen resolution of ________
Control Rock in simulator using AWSD keys.

### Assumptions

User doesnt direct rock to go off of edge of grass field. 

### What we learned
Alini: Having never worked with Unity or c# before, I learned how both of these things were used. I learned various things such
as instantiating gameobjects, working with the camera, and creating the environment for the game. If I end up doing a game in 
Unity for my cs98 project, I have learned the basics and could apply them to my final project

Abby:

### What didn't work
We tried to make an animated terrain with simulated grass but was unable to get that to work. Therefore, we reverted to a base
plane with grass pictures as tiles. The main menu picture was also very basic after struggling to create terrains there too.
